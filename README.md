<h2>Since the VSCode team has offically brought MCP support to Copilot, this extension will now defer to their implementation. All existing configurations will be automatically migrated to the official VSCode implementation.</h2>

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Why aren't my servers appearing in the server list?

This is typically caused by connection timeouts between the MCP SDK and your servers. Here's how to fix it:

1. **Use absolute paths for your executables** - Instead of relative paths, specify the full path to your executable:
   ```
   /home/<user>/.nvm/versions/node/v<version>/bin/npx figma-developer-mcp --stdio --figma-api-key=...
   ```

2. **Find your executable paths** - Not sure where your executables are located? Run this in your terminal:
   ```
   which npx    # or node, uvx, etc.
   ```

Using absolute paths helps prevent connection issues and ensures the MCP SDK can reliably launch your servers.

### Why doesn't tool calling work with Claude 3.7?

The tool calling limitations are imposed by the VSCode API and Copilot Chat. Unfortunately, the tool calling models are limited to Claude 3.5 and GPT-4o. If you still face issues with tool calls, try switching to one or the other just for the tool you want to run. You can force a tool call in these models by using the '#' key and selecting the tool manually in your query.

### How can I use the MCP server tools in Copilot Edits?

You can use the tools in Copilot Edits mode by manually specifying the tool(s) with the '#' key, and selecting the tool from the list:

</div>

### Why isn't Copilot calling my tool?

GitHub Copilot has its own internal system prompt that may be dissuading tool calls in the chat. If you find that Copilot isn't using your tools automatically, try using the manual tool selection method mentioned above.
