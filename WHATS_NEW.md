# What's New in Copilot MCP!

*Sponsored by [Cloud MCP](https://cloudmcp.run?utm_source=copilot-mcp&utm_medium=vscode&utm_campaign=whats-new-0.0.84) - Try out Cloud MCP's [Router Mode](https://cloudmcp.run/blog/cloud-mcp-router?utm_referrer=copilot-mcp) that significantly improves tool calling success by AI agents!*

## Version 0.0.86 + 0.0.87 – Clipboard-Friendly Claude Installs ✂️

- Claude CLI installs now copy the generated command to your clipboard and surface a dedicated notification so you can rerun it quickly if the install fails.

## Version 0.0.85 – Claude Code, Bug Fixes, and Reliability Improvements 🛠

- Unified install controls let you choose between VS Code and Claude Code before running a single install button.
- Claude Code support: Install MCP servers directly into Claude Code (if installed) using stdio or HTTP transports.

## Version 0.0.84 – Remote Registry Installs Are Back 🎯
*(October 8 2025)*

We’ve restored full compatibility with the Official MCP Registry and just added the capability to **add remote HTTP MCP servers** right from Copilot MCP!

What’s new

- Remote endpoints now install cleanly with automatic `${input:...}` prompts for tokens and headers.
- Registry searches are working again, so results appear immediately with updated metadata.
- Remote MCP server results will show an "Install Remote" button that will set up VSCode with the server.


## Version 0.0.80 – Official MCP Registry Search + Direct Installs 🎉
*(September 12 2025)*

Discover and install MCP servers faster and more reliably — now with first‑class support for the Official MCP Registry.

What’s new

- Official MCP Registry provider: Search the public, curated MCP registry right inside the extension. The registry is now the default provider, with the option to switch back to GitHub anytime.
- Direct installs from the registry: Install local packages (npm, PyPI, etc.) or remote endpoints with one click — no copy/paste or manual config. We use the registry’s metadata to set up the right command and arguments automatically.
- Smart, secure prompts: When a server needs API keys or other values, you’ll be prompted at install time. Secrets are captured securely, and missing values are requested so you’re never left guessing.
- Remote server support: Add remote MCP servers by URL from the registry, including headers for authentication when needed.
- Reliability improvements: Ensures the correct package spec is included for installs (so commands like npx/uvx “just work”), fixes for remote‑only servers, and other polish.

We hope this makes discovering and using MCP servers simpler, faster, and more dependable in VSCode. Let us know what you’d like to see next!

## Version 0.0.40 - A Whole New Focus!

We're thrilled to announce a major evolution for **Copilot MCP**!

Previously, this extension assisted with the manual setup of server tools for GitHub Copilot. Many of these tools extend Copilot's abilities by leveraging the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. With recent advancements in Visual Studio Code, which now natively supports the integration of tools via MCP, we saw an opportunity to provide even more value to your Copilot experience.

**Introducing Your New MCP Server Discovery Hub!**

**Copilot MCP** has been completely reimagined and refactored. It's now your go-to tool for **finding and installing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers**. These MCP servers empower GitHub Copilot by connecting it to a vast array of external tools and data sources, significantly expanding its capabilities.

Here's what's new:

*   **Discover MCP Servers on GitHub**: Seamlessly search and browse a growing catalog of open-source MCP servers. Find tools built by the community that enable Copilot to perform new actions and access diverse information.
*   **One-Click Installation**: Gone are the days of manual setup! Leveraging VS Code's native ability to integrate with MCP-compliant server tools, you can now install and configure them with a single click.
*   **Streamlined Workflow**: Get from discovery to using new Copilot tools faster than ever before. We handle the complexities so you can focus on enhancing your AI-assisted development.

We believe this new direction will make it significantly easier for you to unlock the full potential of GitHub Copilot by connecting it to a diverse range of powerful tools and data sources.

We're excited for you to try out the new **Copilot MCP** and welcome your feedback!
