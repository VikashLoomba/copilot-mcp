## Version 0.0.40 - A Whole New Focus!

We're thrilled to announce a major evolution for **Copilot MCP**!

Previously, this extension assisted with the manual setup of server tools for GitHub Copilot. Many of these tools extend Copilot's abilities by leveraging the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. With recent advancements in Visual Studio Code, which now natively supports the integration of tools via MCP, we saw an opportunity to provide even more value to your Copilot experience.

**Introducing Your New MCP Server Discovery Hub!**

**Copilot MCP** has been completely reimagined and refactored. It's now your go-to tool for **finding and installing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers**. These MCP servers empower GitHub Copilot by connecting it to a vast array of external tools and data sources, significantly expanding its capabilities.

Here's what's new:

*   **Discover MCP Servers on GitHub**: Seamlessly search and browse a growing catalog of open-source MCP servers. Find tools built by the community that enable Copilot to perform new actions and access diverse information.
*   **One-Click Installation**: Gone are the days of manual setup! Leveraging VS Code's native ability to integrate with MCP-compliant server tools, you can now install and configure them with a single click.
*   **Streamlined Workflow**: Get from discovery to using new Copilot tools faster than ever before. We handle the complexities so you can focus on enhancing your AI-assisted development.

We believe this new direction will make it significantly easier for you to unlock the full potential of GitHub Copilot by connecting it to a diverse range of powerful tools and data sources.

We're excited for you to try out the new **Copilot MCP** and welcome your feedback!
